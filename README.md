This is super lightweight auto clicker was made in VBA long ago. The code of this project would use a cleanup but none the less is very reliable as-is. Unlike terditional auto clickers, this one has focused on end-users day to day usability within features. Not all situations need a mouse clicker but rather a key presser.

This tool contains the following features:
- Left, Middle, Right, Left + Right, or None mouse key clicker.
- Ability to scroll through the numpad numbers.  
- Hold shift key while running the spammer.
- Spam any desired keyboard buttons or combinations. 
- Speed super multiplier for insane clock speeds.
